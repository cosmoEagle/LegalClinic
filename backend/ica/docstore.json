B examines the accounts of the factory, which show that only four hundred maunds of indigo have been made. After thi s \nB buys the factory.

This is a contract of indemnity. \n125.Rights of indemnity -holder wh en sued .\u2014The promisee in a contract of indemnity, acting \nwithin the scope of his authority, is entitled to recover from the promisor\u2014 \n(1) all damages which he may be compelled to pay in any suit in respect of any matter to which \nthe promise to indemnify applies; \n(2) all costs which he may be compelled to pay in any such suit if , in bringing or defending it, he \ndid not contravene the orders of the promisor, and acted as it would have been prudent for him to act \nin the absence of any contract of indemnity, or if the promisor authorized him to bring or defend the \nsuit; \n(3) all sums which he may have paid under the terms of any compromise of any such sui t, if the \ncompromise was not contrary to the orders of the promisor, and was one which it would have been \nprudent for the promisee to make in the absence of any contract of indemnity,  or if the promisor \nauthorized him to compromise the suit. \n126. \u201cContract of guarantee \u201d, \u201csurety\u201d, \u201cprincipal debtor \u201d and \u201ccreditor\u201d.\u2014A \u201ccontract of \nguarantee\u201d is a contract to perform the promise, or discharge the liability, of a third person in case of his \ndefault. The person who gives the guarantee is called the \u201csurety\u201d; the person in respect of whose default \nthe guarantee is given is called the \u201cprincipal debtor\u201d, and the person to whom the guarantee is given is \ncalled the \u201ccreditor\u201d. A guarantee may be either oral or written. \n127. Consideration for guarantee .\u2014Anything done, or any promise made, for the benefit of the \nprincipal debtor, may be a sufficient consideration to the surety for giving the guarantee. \nIllustrations \n(a) B requests A to sell and deliver to him goods on credit. A agrees to do so, provided C will guarantee the payment of the \nprice of the goods. C promises to guarantee the payment in cons ideration of A\u2019s promise to deliver the goods. This is a sufficient \nconsideration for C\u2019s promise. \n(b) A sells and delivers goods to B. C afterwards requests A to forbear to sue B for the debt for a year, and promises that, if  \nhe does so, C will pay for them in default of payment by B. A agrees to forbear as requested. This is a sufficient consideration for \nC\u2019s promise. \n(c) A sells and delivers goods to B. C afterwards, without consideration, agrees to pay for them in defau lt of B.

Surety\u2019s liability.\u2014The liability of the surety is co - extensive with that of the principal debtor, \nunless it is otherwise provided by the contract. \nIllustration \nA guarantees to B the payment of a bill of exchange by C, the acceptor. The bill is dishonoured by C.

B \ndelivers five sacks to C. C pays for them. Afterwards B delivers four sacks to C, which C does riot pay for. The guarantee given \nby A was not a continuing guarantee, and accordingly he is not liable for the price of the four sacks. \n130.Revocation of continuing guarantee.\u2014A continuing guarantee may at any time be revoked by \nthe surety, as to future transactions, by notice to the creditor. \nIllustrations \n(a) A, in consideration of B \u2019s discounting, at A \u2019s request, bills of exchange for C, guarantees to B, for twelve months, the \ndue payment of all such bills to the extent of 5,000 rupees. B discounts bills for C to the extent of 2,000 rupees. Afterwards, at the \nend of three months, A revokes the guarantee. This revocation discharges A from all liability to B for any subsequent dis count. \nBut A is liable to B for the 2,000 rupees, on default of C. \n(b) A guarantees to B, to the extent of 10,000 rupees, that C shall pay all the bills that B shall draw upon him. B draws upon \nC. C accepts the bill. A gives notice of revocation. C dishonours the bill at maturity. A is liable upon his guarantee. \n131.Revocation of continuing guarantee by surety \u2019s death.\u2014The death of the surety operates, in \nthe absence of any contract to the contrary, as a revocation of a continuing guarantee, so far as regards \nfuture transactions. \n132. Liability of two persons, primarily liable, not affected by arrangement between them that \none shall be surety on other \u2019s default.\u2014Where two persons contract with a third person to undertake a \ncertain liability, and also contract with each other that one of them shall be liable only on the default of \nthe other, the third person not being a party to such contract, the liability of each of such two persons to \nthe third person under the first contract is not affected by the e xistence of the second contract, although \nsuch third person may have been aware of its existence. \nIllustration \nA and B make a joint and several promissory note to C.

The person \ndelivering the goods is called the \u201cbailor\u201d. The person to whom they are delivered is called, the \u201cbailee\u201d. \nExplanation.\u2014If a person already in possession of the goods of another contracts to hold them as a \nbailee, he thereby becomes the bailee, and the owner becomes th e bailor of such goods, although they \nmay not have been delivered by way of bailment. \n149. Delivery to bailee how made .\u2014The delivery to the bailee may be made by doing anything \nwhich has the effect of putting the goods in the possession of the intended bai lee or of any person \nauthorized to hold them on his behalf. \n150.Bailor\u2019s duty to d isclose faults in goods bailed .\u2014The bailor is bound to disclose to the bailee \nfaults in the goods bailed, of which the bailor is  aware, and which materially interfere with the use of \nthem, or expose the bailee to extraordinary risks; and if he does not make such disclosure, he is \nresponsible for damage arising to the bailee directly from such faults. \nIf the goods are bailed for hire, the bailor is responsible for such damage , whether he was or was not \naware of the existence of such faults in the goods bailed. \nIllustrations \n(a)A lends a horse, which he knows to be vicious, to B. He does not disclose the fact that the horse is vicious. The horse \nruns away. B is thrown and injured. A is responsible to B for damage sustained. \n(b)A hires a carriage of B. The carriage is unsafe, though B is not aware of it, and A is injured. B is r esponsible to A for the \ninjury. \n1151. Care to be taken by bailee .\u2014In all cases of bailment the bai lee is bound to take as much care \nof the goods bailed to him as a man of ordinary prudence would, under similar circumstances, take of his \nown goods of the same bulk, quality and value as the goods bailed2. \n152.Bailee when not liable for loss, etc., of thing bailed.\u2014The bailee, in the absence of any special \ncontract, is not responsible for the loss, destruction or deterioration of the thing bailed, if he has taken the \namount of care of it described in section 151. \n153.
