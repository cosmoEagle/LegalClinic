Alternative prayer for rescission in suit for specific performance.\u2014A plaintiff instituting a suit \nfor the specific performance of a contract in writing may pray in the alternative that, if the contract cannot \nbe specifically enforced, it may be rescinded and delivered up to be cancelled; and the court, if it refuses to \nenforce the contract specifically, may direct it to be rescinded and delivered up accordingly. \n30.

Perpetual injunction when granted.\u2014(1) Subject to the other provisions contained in or referred \nto by this Chapter, a  perpetual injunction may be granted to the plaintiff to prevent the breach of an \nobligation existing in his favour, whether expressly or by implication. \n(2) When any such obligation arises from contract, the court shall be guided by the rules and provisions \ncontained in Chapter II. \n(3) When the defendant invades or threatens to invade the plaintiff\u2019s right to, or enjoyment of, property, \nthe court may grant a perpetual injunction in the following cases, namely:\u2014 \n(a) where the defendant is trustee of the property for the plaintiff; \n(b) where there exists no standard for ascertaining the actual damage caused, or likely to be caused, \nby the invasion; \n(c) where the invasion is such that compensation in money would not afford adequate relief; \n(d) where the injunction is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of judicial proceedings. \n39. Mandatory injunctions.\u2014When, to prevent the breach of an obligation, it is necessary to compel \nthe performance of certain acts which the court is capable of enforcing, the court may in its discretion grant \nan injunction to prevent the breach complained of, and also to compel performance of the requisite acts. \n40. Damages in lieu of, or in addition to, injunction .\u2014(1) The plaintiff in a suit for perpetual \ninjunction under section 38, or  mandatory injunction  under section 39, may claim damages either in \naddition to, or in substitution for, such injunction and the court may, if it thinks fit, award such damages. \n(2) No relief for damages shall be granted under this section unless the plaintiff has claimed such relief \nin his plaint: \nProvided that where no such damages have been claimed in the plaint, the court shall, at any stage of \nthe proceedings, allow the plaintiff to amend the plaint on such terms as may be just for including such \nclaim. \n(3) The dismissal of a suit to prevent the breach of an obligation existing in favour of the plaintiff shall \nbar his right to sue for damages for such breach.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3406, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d440726-a91c-4608-a5e0-dbe6f9dc1519": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d440726-a91c-4608-a5e0-dbe6f9dc1519", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "sra.pdf", "file_path": "data/sra.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 259229, "creation_date": "2025-04-19", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dc925215-0c65-4516-9539-12807fa461c4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "sra.pdf", "file_path": "data/sra.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 259229, "creation_date": "2025-04-19", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-19"}, "hash": "a3c05d28522ff7c5ff697186cd75dec3568f9cce1a096d6ccf4fcd755e62e8bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "15 \n \n41.
