Conditional transfer to one person coupled with transfer to another on failure of prior \ndisposition.\u2014Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created in favour of one person, and \nby the same transaction an ulterior disposition of the same interest is made in favour of another, if the \nprior disposition under the transfer shall fail, the ulterior disposition shall take effect upon the failure of \nthe prior disposition, although the failure may not have occurred in the manner contemplated by the \ntransferor. \nBut, where the intention of the parties to the transaction is that the ulterior disposition shall take effect \nonly in the event of the prior disposition failing in a particular manner, the ulterior disposition shall not \ntake effect unless the prior disposition fails in that manner. \nIllustrations \n(a) A transfers Rs. 500 to B on condition that he shall execute a certain lease within three months after A \u2019s death, and, \nif he should neglect to do so, to C.

B marries when only 17 years of age, without C's consent. \nThe transfer to D takes effect. \n30. Prior disposition not affected by invalidity of ulterior disposition .\u2014If the ulterior disposition \nis not valid, the prior disposition is not affected by it. \nIllustration \nA transfers a farm to B for her life, and, if she do not desert her husband to C. B is entitled to the farm during her life as \nif no condition had been inserted. \n31. Condition that transfer shall cease to have effect in case specified uncertain event happens \nor does not happen.\u2014Subject to the provisions of section 12, on a transfer of property an interest therein \nmay be created with the condition superadded that it shall cease to exist in case a specified uncertain \nevent shall happen, or in case a specified uncertain event shall not happen. \nIllustrations \n(a) A transfers a farm to B for his life, with  a proviso that, in case B cuts down a certain wood, the transfer shall cease \nto have any effect. B cuts down the wood. He loses his life-interest in the farm. \n(b) A transfers a farm to B, provided that, if B shall not go  to England within three years after the date of the transfer, \nhis interest in the farm shall cease. B does not go to England within the term prescribed. His interest in the farm ceases. \n32. Such condition must not be invalid.\u2014In order that a condition that an interest shall cease to \nexist may be valid, it is necessary that the event to which it relates be one which could legally constitute \nthe condition of the creation of an interest. \n33.
